## Overview
SnakeEyes Dice Roller is a lightweight, Windows desktop application written in Python, designed to facilitate quick and easy dice rolling for tabletop gamers and other users who rely on screen readers, particularly NVDA. The app prioritizes accessibility and usability to ensure visually impaired users can independently perform dice rolls with confidence and accuracy.

- **Accessible UI:** Fully compatible with NVDA screen reader.
- **Multiple Dice Types:** Support for d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20 
- **Custom Rolls:** Allows rolling multiple dice and modifiers.
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Complete keyboard-driven interface, no mouse needed.
- **Audio Feedback:** Clear verbal feedback of roll results.
- **History Log:** Keeps a session history of recent rolls for reference.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal resource usage and fast startup time.
- **Portable:** No complex installation required; runs as standalone Python app.
